# OpenBloxLoader

> [!WARNING]
> This project is still a work in progress (WIP). We **do not** recommend using it, as it may cause bugs, and this project was made purely for gaining skills in the `Go` language.

Open-source bootstrapper for Roblox, written in `Go`. This is a **third-party** replacement for the standard Roblox bootstrapper, as well as a ***base project for developers*** to start making their own replacement bootstrapper.

Running into a bug or problem? Please submit an issue on the Git service platform that you are using right now, as we maintain two mirrors of this project.

## Mirrors

We maintain two mirrors for redundancy in case:
- Our repository gets removed
- Code files are deleted
- Any other unforeseen events

We provide two options:

- For those who prefer FOSS platforms and want to know what is in the Git service they're using:
[Codeberg Mirror](https://codeberg.org/techplayz32/OpenBloxLoader)

- For those who are new and just want to download the bootstrapper:
[Github Mirror](https://github.com/techplayz32/OpenBloxLoader)

We plan to set up a Bugzilla bug tracker when the project becomes more popular.
For workflows (building nightly versions of the project), we are currently using the Github mirror as the main repository, but we'll maintain activity on Codeberg as we prefer it over Github.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Is this malware?**

**A:** No. Our repositories would be immediately removed from both platforms if they contained malware. Additionally, we provide the complete source code, making it impossible to hide malicious code without detection.

**Q: Why does my anti-virus flag it as malware?**

**A:** This happens because our executables are not digitally signed, which would require significant money and time to implement.

**Q: Can using this get me banned from Roblox?**

**A:** No, it shouldn't. OpenBloxLoader doesn't include exploits or any functionality that violates Roblox guidelines.
