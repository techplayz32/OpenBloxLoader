# OpenBloxLoader

> [!WARNING]
> This project is still a work in progress (WIP). We **do not** recommend using it, as it may cause bugs, and this project was made purely for gaining skills in the `Go` language.

Open-source bootstrapper for Roblox, written in `Go`. This is a **third-party** replacement for the standard Roblox bootstrapper, as well ***base project for developers*** to start making their own replacement of bootstrapper.

Running into a bug or problem? Please submit an issue on Git service platform that you are using right now, as we have two mirrors of this project.

# Mirrors

We have two mirrors in case of situations like:
- our repository getting nuked,
- we will have one of them code files deleted
or any other event.

We decided on making like that:

- for those people who like FOSS and want know what is written in Git service that they are using,
[Codeberg Mirror](https://codeberg.org/techplayz32/OpenBloxLoader)

- for those people who are newbies and just want to download this bootstrapper,
[Github Mirror](https://github.com/techplayz32/OpenBloxLoader)

We will planning on making Bugzilla bug tracker, but only when project will start becoming more popular.
For workflows (building nightly versions of the project), we will be using Github mirror as the main one repository right now, but we will try to be active on Codeberg, since we prefer it more over Github.

# Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Is this malware?**

**A:** Nope, our both of repositories would be immediately deleted off the platforms, as well we showing the source code of app, and **it'd be impossible to put malware in it without getting caught**.

**Q: Then why my anti-virus says that it is a malware??!!**

**A:** Since we are not digitally signed.. and that would take a lot of money and time to digitally sign our executables.

**Q: Can using this get me banned?**

**A:** No, and probably it shouldn't. OpenBloxLoader doesn't do anything like putting exploits or anything suspicious which violating guidelines of Roblox.
